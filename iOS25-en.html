            <h5>What is the problem?</h5>
            <p>To publish applications in the AppStore and support them, <b>Apple collects a subscription fee of $99 annually from each developer</b>. <i>The rationale for such fees is to support the company's ecosystem.</i> Here is a screenshot from <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple's developer account</a>, which shows both the subscription date and price. <br/><br/> 
                <img class="screen mobile" alt="screen" src="res/screen-d.webp"/>
                If the developer does not make the payment, Apple deletes the application itself and all developer data from the AppStore. <b>Moreover, the application installed on your device will stop working and all data will be completely lost if the subscription is not paid on time (before 02/17/2025).</b></p>

        <section>
            <h5>Как Вы можете помочь?</h5>
            <p>We, as developers, are currently unable to cover the contribution amount without harming ourselves. <b>We need to collect donations in the remaining days to somehow cover the contribution amount.</b> Since you, as a user of this application, are interested in its preservation no less than we are, <b>we are asking you for financial support</b> to pay for the subscription. <i>We do not need any other fees at the moment.</i></p>

        <section>
            <h5>What amount and how to transfer?</h5>
            <p>Total amount at the start: <b>4200 UAH</b>, approximately 99 US dollars at the current rate. Any contribution from you will help the common cause: at least 10 UAH, at least 200 UAH. <b>To transfer, use the button below</b>, it is absolutely safe and completely anonymous. <i>We will publish a detailed report on the transfer of all funds in our telegram chat.</i></p>
